Musical acts made up of attractive and talented young people have been a reliable recipe for success for decades. One Direction reigned in 2010, the rivalries between Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera defined pop music in the ’90s, and New Kids On The Block was an ‘80s acid-wash teen dream. But on November 19, 2017, the K-pop band BTS took to the AMA stage for their first-ever U.S. performance and shook the American music industry. BTS would go on to set the record for most Twitter engagements, grace the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine, record with Lil Nas X on Old Town Road (Seoul Town Road Remix), sing carpool Karaoke, and solidify their international stardom. The Korean Wave that started in the ‘80s finally crested over the United States. It’s been four years since BTS performed at the AMAs and burst into the American mainstream. But it would be a disservice to the genre to say that K-pop started when BTS burst on the scene.

K-pop or Korean Pop is the internationally popular, aesthetic-driven, style-bending, trendsetting, music genre of the 21st century. Originating in South Korea, K-pop draws influence from a range of genres like pop, experimental, rock, hip-hop, R&B, electronic, and dance. The variety of influences is so vast there’s a K-pop band or performer for every taste. There are massive girl groups like Girls Generation who produce straightforward pop hits. But if you like pop with rap breaks inspired by the rapid lyrical styles of Nicki Minaj then check out BLACKPINK. If your taste skews more alt, then the emo-stylized group F.T. ISLAND is for you. And if you want some slow and sensual R&B, g.o.d. has the jams. But, despite the genre-straddling K-pop is a thoroughly Korean genre. The tunes are inspired by traditional Korean music and the lyrics are in Korean with the occasional English sprinkled throughout.
